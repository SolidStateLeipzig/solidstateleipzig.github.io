## Permittivity

Response to the external electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is described by **permittivity** ($\varepsilon$) of the crystal. This parameter shows the onset of the **electric polarization** $\mathbf{P}$ and of the corresponding **displacement field** $\mathbf{D}$,

$$
 \mathbf{D}=\varepsilon \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}=\varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P},
$$ (eq-basic-D)
as local dipoles build up in the crystal and/or become aligned with the applied field. 

Polarization is defined as the dipole moment per unit of volume, $P=n_d\mu_d$ where $n_d$ is the dipole concentration and $\mu_d$ is the moment of a single dipole. $P$ has the units of  $C/m^2$ and also serves as a measure of charge per area, but one should remember that this charge is always compensated by the same charge of the opposite sign sitting somewhere else in the crystal. 

It is also customary to define **dielectric susceptibility**,
$$
 \chi_e=\frac{P}{\varepsilon_0 E}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad\varepsilon=1+\chi_e.
$$ (eq-chi-eps)
Both $\varepsilon$ and $\chi_e$ are $3\times 3$ tensors that reduce to scalars in cubic crystals.
```{note}
In the general case, $\chi_e$ is the derivative of $\mathbf{P}$ with respect to $\mathbf{E}$.
```


Both dielectric susceptibility and permittivity are frequency-dependent complex numbers. One typically separates them into the real and imaginary parts,

$$
 \varepsilon(\omega)=\varepsilon'+i\varepsilon''\qquad{\rm and}\qquad\chi_e(\omega)=\chi_e'+i\chi_e''
$$

that show, respectively, the polarization in-phase and out-of-phase with the oscillating electric field, $E=E_0\,e^{-i\omega t}$. Indeed, 

$$
 P=\chi_e'E_0\,e^{-i\omega t}+ \chi_e''E_0\,ie^{-i\omega t}=(\varepsilon'-1)E_0\,e^{-i\omega t}+\varepsilon''E_0\,ie^{-i\omega t}.
$$

At low frequencies, $\varepsilon'$ approaches static permittivity $\varepsilon_{\rm st}$, whereas $\varepsilon''$ vanishes. At high frequencies, $\varepsilon'$ approaches 1 (vacuum permittivity), because electric field oscillates too fast to induce any polarization, and $\varepsilon''$ again vanishes.


## Dielectric loss

Complex permittivity shows the energy loss (heating) of a dielectric in oscillating electric fields. Consider Maxwell's equation~\eqref{eq:max4} that in the absence of the magnetic field can be represented as,

$$
 \mathbf{j}=-\frac{\partial\mathbf{D}}{\partial t}=-\varepsilon_0\omega\,(i\varepsilon'-\varepsilon'')\,\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{j}_{\perp}+\mathbf{j}_{\|}.
$$

No electric current flows through the dielectric, but there is an instantaneous local current generated by dipoles that move in order to get aligned with the applied field. This ``dipole current'' comprises two components, which are perpendicular and parallel to the field, respectively. Joule heating is given by $\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{j}$, so only $\varepsilon''$ ($\mathbf{j}_{\|}$) is responsible for the heating.

The imaginary permittivity ($\varepsilon''$) is often called **dielectric loss**. One also defines the **loss tangent**,

$$
 \tg\delta=\frac{\varepsilon''}{\varepsilon'}=\frac{|\mathbf{j}_{\|}|}{|\mathbf{j}_{\perp}|}
$$

with the **loss angle** $\delta$. The loss tangent and loss angle show how much heat is produced by a dielectric placed into an oscillating electric field. Materials with low dielectric loss are required in power applications to avoid heating by the ac-field. On the other hand, commercial microwave ovens are tuned to the frequency that renders the large dielectric loss in water. Therefore, food can be microwaved and heated, whereas its container remains cold.

## Induced dipoles and polarizability

Local dipoles in dielectrics can be divided into two groups, **permanent** and **induced**. Permanent dipoles occur in polar molecules and crystals. They carry some dipole moment that can be turned by the applied electric field, resulting in **orientation polarization**. By contrast, induced dipoles arise from the polarization of those atoms and molecules that would remain nonpolar in the absence of the applied field. One prominent example of this mechanism is the **ionic polarization** due to an optical phonon (Ch.~\ref{sec:optical}). 

Induced dipole moments are proportional to the electric field,

$$
 \mathbf{\mu}_d=\alpha\,\mathbf{E}_{\rm local}
$$ (eq-polarizability)

where $\alpha$ is **polarizability** (again, tensor property that in lucky cases can be reduced to a scalar). This definition is quite tricky because it involves local electric field near the atom/molecule, which is generally different from the applied electric field. We will deal with this problem shortly. For now let's notice that polarizability has rather non-intuitive SI units of C m $^2$/V or Fm $^2$. It becomes much more palatable in [electrostatic CGS units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre-gram-second_system_of_units#Electrostatic_units_(ESU)) [$\varepsilon_0=1/(4\pi)$] where $\alpha$ is measured in cm $^3$ and corresponds to an effective volume of an atom/molecule.

## Local electric field

Local electric field from Eq.~\eqref{eq:polarizability} includes three contributions (Fig.~\ref{fig:local-field}),

$$
 \mathbf{E}_{\rm local}=\mathbf{E}_{\rm ext}+\mathbf{E}_{\rm depol}+\mathbf{E}_L.
$$(eq-local-1)

One is the external field $\mathbf{E}_{\rm ext}$, the second one is the depolarizing field $\mathbf{E}_{\rm depol}$ arising from charges that accumulate on the surface, and the third one is the Lorentz field $\mathbf{E}_L$ due to charges in the interior of the dielectric. The first two terms, $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_{\rm ex}+\mathbf{E}_{\rm depol}$, build up the electric field used in Maxwell's equations. 

One good thing about $\mathbf{E}_{\rm depol}$ and $\mathbf{E}_L$ is that they are proportional to polarization, because both fields arise from charges inside the dielectric and on its surface. The **depolarizing field** depends on the sample shape,

$$
 \mathbf{E}_{\rm depol}=-f\,\frac{\mathbf{P}}{\varepsilon_0},
$$

where $f$ is the **depolarization factor**, basically a form factor. Its calculation is a rather tedious exercise in electrostatics that, reportedly, Landau gave to his students as one problem of the ``theory minimum''. Less ambitious students should be alright with the simple knowledge that flat sample features $f=1$ because a lot of charge is accumulated on its surfaces, and it acts as a capacitor of some sort. By contrast,  needle-like sample features $f=0$. Spherical sample is somewhat in between with its $f=\frac13$, as we will see shortly.

Right: calculation of the Lorentz field by slicing the sphere and evaluating the electric field $\delta E_L$ created by each slice in its center.
```

**Lorentz field** arises from charges in the interior of the dielectric. Envisage a small spherical hole that has been cut out inside the sample. The charge accumulated on this new surface produces electric field in the center of the sphere and acts opposite to the depolarizing field. We introduce spherical coordinates with the polar angle $\theta$ that gauges the angle with respect to $\mathbf{E}$. We then slice the sphere perpendicular to the direction of $\mathbf{E}$, such that each slice is a ring with the radius $R\sin\theta$ and thickness $R\,d\theta$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:local-field}, right). The polarization is maximum in the zenith and minimum at $\theta=\pi/2$, hence for a given slice $P(\theta)=-P\cos\theta$, and the overall charge on the slice is polarization times area, namely,

$$
 \delta q=-P\cos\theta\times 2\pi R\sin\theta\times Rd\theta=-2\pi R^2P\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta.
$$

Electric field imposed by such a ring is 

$$
 \delta E_L=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{\delta q}{R^2}.
$$

The components perpendicular to $\mathbf{E}$ cancel, whereas those parallel to $\mathbf{E}$ contribute to the overall field created by the ring. Therefore, we should take the projection of $\delta E_L$, which adds the factor of $\cos\theta$, resulting in

$$
 \delta E_L^{\|}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{\delta q}{R^2}\,\cos\theta=\frac{P}{2\varepsilon_0}\cos^2\theta\sin\theta\,d\theta
$$
for the electric field produced by the ring. We are left to integrate this over $\theta$,

$$
 \mathbf{E}_L=\frac{\mathbf{P}}{2\varepsilon_0}\int_0^{\pi}\cos^2\theta\sin\theta\,d\theta=\frac{\mathbf{P}}{2\varepsilon_0}\int_{-1}^{1}\cos^2\theta\,d(\cos\theta)=\left.\frac{\mathbf{P}}{2\varepsilon_0}\frac{\cos^3\theta}{3}\right|_{-1}^1=\frac{\mathbf{P}}{3\,\varepsilon_0}.

$$ (eq-lorentz-field)
This calculation also elucidates the depolarization factor of $f=\frac13$ for the sphere. 

## Clausius-Mossotti relation

Induced dipole moments depend on the local field that, in turn, depends on the polarization created by these dipoles. Therefore, *microscopic* polarizability of atoms/molecules is directly related to the *macroscopic* permittivity of the sample. Consider $\mathbf{E}_{\rm local}=\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{E}_L$ and use it in the definition of the polarization. One one hand,

$$
 \mathbf{P}=n_d\mu_d=n_d\alpha\mathbf{E}_{\rm local}=n_d\,\alpha\left(\mathbf{E}+\frac{\mathbf{P}}{3\,\varepsilon_0}\right).
$$

On the other hand,

$$
 \mathbf{P}=\chi_e\varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}=(\varepsilon-1)\varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}.
$$

By evaluating $\mathbf{E}$ and canceling $\mathbf{P}$, one finds 

$$
 \frac{\varepsilon-1}{\varepsilon+2}=\frac{\chi_e}{3+\chi_e}=\frac{n_d\,\alpha}{3\varepsilon_0},
$$ (eq-clausius)

the **Clausius-Mossotti relation**, also known as the **Lorentz-Lorenz equation**. Simple at first glance, it has been very significant historically, because it offered the very first experimental tool for probing molecular property (polarizability) using a macroscopic measurement (permittivity).

(sec-debye-relaxation)=
## Permanent dipoles, Debye relaxation

Let's now consider permanent dipoles. To a first approximation, they do not change their dipole moment, yet they turn in order to get aligned with the field. This rotation takes time and causes a delay between $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{E}$, hence the imaginary part of $\varepsilon$. To analyze this delay, consider first a simple situation when external electric field is changed abruptly. We assume exponential nature of the relaxation with the characteristic **relaxation time** $\tau$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:debye-relaxation}), such that

$$
 P(t)=P_{\rm st}\left(1+e^{-t/\tau}\right)\quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{dP}{dt}=-\frac{P(t)-P_{\rm st}}{\tau}
$$ (eq-debye-2)

where $P_{\rm st}=\varepsilon_0\chi_0E$ is the static polarization reached at $t\rightarrow\infty$ assuming that the field does not change. 

\begin{figure}

```

Using the standard ansatz $P(t)=P_0\,e^{-i\omega t}$, we find

$$
 P_0=\frac{\varepsilon_0\chi_0E_0}{1-i\omega\tau}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \chi_e=\frac{P}{\varepsilon_0E}=\frac{\chi_0}{1-i\omega\tau},
$$ (eq-debye-3)

the Debye relaxation. It is a standard form of a response function for a system with the single relaxation time. We will see it again when we come to discuss ac-conductivity of metals (Ch.~\ref{sec:sigma-ac}). For now, let's get more familiar with the expressions. Using $\chi=\chi'+i\chi''$, one finds

$$
 \chi_e'(\omega)=\frac{\chi_0}{1+\omega^2\tau^2},\quad\chi_e''(\omega)=\frac{\chi_0\,\omega\tau}{1+\omega^2\tau^2},
$$

where $\chi_0$ is static susceptibility.

We can also use Eq.~\eqref{eq:chi-eps} to calculate permittivity,

$$
 \varepsilon'(\omega)=1+\frac{\varepsilon_{\rm st}-1}{1+\omega^2\tau^2},\quad\varepsilon''(\omega)=\frac{(\varepsilon_{\rm st}-1)\,\omega\tau}{1+\omega^2\tau^2},

$$ (eq-debye-4)

with the static permittivity $\varepsilon_{\rm st}=1+\chi_0$. The imaginary component $\varepsilon''(\omega)$ has a peak-like structure with the maximum at $\omega\tau=1$, i.e., at a characteristic relaxation frequency determined by the relaxation time $\tau$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:debye-relaxation}). It is the target frequency if we want to maximize dielectric loss and heat the sample by microwave radiation.
```{note}
Commercial microwave ovens operate at 2.4 GHz, which is somewhat away from the peak of $\varepsilon''(\omega)$ for water, in order to avoid overheating.
```
The real part $\varepsilon'$ equals static permittivity at $\omega=0$ and decays to 1 at $\omega\rightarrow\infty$. 

Debye relaxation occurs at frequencies determined by the value of $\tau$. Liquids feature relaxation times on the order of picoseconds and the $\varepsilon''(\omega)$ peak in the GHz range. In solids, dipoles are more constrained, so their relaxation time increases to milliseconds, whereas the peak shifts into the kHz range. All of these frequencies are anyway much lower than typical phonon frequencies, which lie in the THz range. In fact, Debye relaxation is never the only process induced by the oscillating electric field, and $\varepsilon'(\omega)$ never reaches 1 at high frequencies (see also Ch.~\ref{sec:optical}). This aspect is taken into account by the modified expression where we introduced the high-frequency limit $\varepsilon_{\infty}$,

$$
 \varepsilon(\omega)=\varepsilon_{\infty}+\frac{\varepsilon_{\rm st}-\varepsilon_{\infty}}{1+i\omega\tau}.
$$ (eq-debye-final)

Here, ``high frequency'' means the frequency well above the frequency $\omega=1/\tau$ of the Debye relaxation.



## Cole-Cole plots

In practical dielectric measurements, one seeks to determine the relaxation time(s) of the system. To this end, **Cole-Cole plots** of $\varepsilon''$ vs. $\varepsilon'$ with $\omega$ as an implicit parameter are commonly used. Debye relaxation gives rise to the semicircular Cole-Cole plot, because all points defined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:debye-final} lie on the semi-circle centered at $(\varepsilon_{\rm st}+\varepsilon_{\infty})/2$ and having the radius of $(\varepsilon_{\rm st}-\varepsilon_{\infty})/2$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:cole}.

```

The model of Debye relaxation works well for liquids like water or ethanol. In more complex cases, and especially in mixtures of liquids, multiple relaxation times may be present, and the semi-circle becomes deformed. Some common approximations in this case are the **Cole-Cole equation**,

$$
 \hat\varepsilon(\omega)=\varepsilon_{\infty}+\frac{\varepsilon_{\rm st}-\varepsilon_{\infty}}{1+(i\omega\tau)^{1-\alpha}},
$$ (eq-cole-cole)

and the **Davidson-Cole equation**, 

$$
 \hat\varepsilon(\omega)=\varepsilon_{\infty}+\frac{\varepsilon_{\rm st}-\varepsilon_{\infty}}{(1+i\omega\tau)^{\beta}}.

$$ (eq-davidson-cole)

Needless to say, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be used at the same time, thus leaving even more flexibility. The Cole-Cole equation renders the $\varepsilon''$ vs. $\varepsilon'$ graph non-circular, while keeping the symmetry with respect to the mid-point at $(\varepsilon_{\rm st}-\varepsilon_{\infty})/2$. In contrast, the Davidson-Cole relaxation leads to a semi-circle stretched on one side and suppressed on the other (Fig.~\ref{fig:cole}). The Cole-Cole plots are widely used for analyzing relaxation behavior based on frequency-dependent measurements, not only in dielectrics but also for example in spin glass.
