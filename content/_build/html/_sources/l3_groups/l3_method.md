## Circular birefrigence and dichroism

Chirality has direct implications for optical properties. Previously (Ch.~\ref{sec:rotation}), we discussed birefringence as the different refraction of light depending on its polarization relative to the crystal directions. A counterpart of this effect is **dichroism**, the different absorption of light depending on its polarization.
```{note} More generally, birefringence and dichroism describe anisotropy for the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, respectively. See also Ch.~\ref{sec:reflectivity}.

Crystals with a suitable symmetry may change color on rotation when illuminated by the linearly polarized light. This is **linear dichroism** (different absorption of linearly polarized light) also known as [pleochroism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleochroism) in the context of minerals.

A similar effect in chiral crystals is known as **circular birefringence** and **circular dichroism**. Here, one uses left- and right- circularly polarized light and observes their different refraction or absorption. Circular birefringence is the manifestation of an **optical rotation**. The polarization direction turns when light goes through a chiral material. This has been the earliest experimental tool for identifying chirality. It can be observed in very common systems, such as crystalline sugar and sugar syrup.
