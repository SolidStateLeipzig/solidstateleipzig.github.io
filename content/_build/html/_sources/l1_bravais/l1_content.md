## Bravais lattice and unit cell

Periodic pattern of the crystal can be described by a **Bravais lattice** defined as a set of points
$$ 
\mathbf{R} = n_1 \mathbf{a} + n_2 \mathbf{b} + n_3 \mathbf{c}
$$
where $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$ are integers and $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{c}$ are three vectors that do not lie in the same plane. They are known as **lattice translations** or **lattice vectors**. The parallelepiped spun by these three vectors is the repetition unit of the lattice or its **unit cell** with the **lattice parameters** ($a,b,c$) and **lattice angles** ($\alpha,\beta,\gamma$). It is customary to define the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ as $\alpha$, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ as $\beta$, and the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\gamma$.
