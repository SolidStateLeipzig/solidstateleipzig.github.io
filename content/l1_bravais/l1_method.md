## Electron microscopy

Back in time researchers could only guess about lattice periodicity and packing. Nowadays it is possible to visualize the crystal lattice and even see individual atoms with the direct imaging done by electron microscopy. Electron microscopes are somewhat similar to common optical microscopes, but they use electrons as radiation with the much shorter wavelength, and of course they require a much more sophisticated system of electromagnetic lenses to direct and focus the electron beams. 

Electron microscopes come in two main varieties:
* **transmission electron microscopes** (TEM) collect electrons on a detector behind the sample, just like an optical microscope does with visible light

* **scanning electron microscopes** (SEM) collect secondary electrons that are produced when electrons are scattered on the sample
SEM's are more compact, because one does not need a long separation between the sample and detector. They can also map a larger area by scanning the sample with the electron beam (hence the name). Concurrently, they lack in resolution. A typical instrument of this type has the resolution of about 10 nm and can be used for imaging microstructures but not individual atoms. By contrast, modern TEM's have the resolution of 1 $\mathring{A}$. They can operate in different imaging modes and highlight heavy or light atoms, or map out chemical composition and even electronic states on the sub-nm scale.

Two points of concern when using electron microscopy are:
* small size of the probe; a region of only $20-30$ nm is probed in a single image taken with the atomic resolution. This problem is partially mitigated by STEM (scanning TEM), but even in this case only a tiniest fraction of the sample volume can be studied

* sample damage caused by the strong electron beam and high vacuum

Electron microscopy is the method of choice for studying defects and microstructures. When it comes to long-range-ordered crystals, electron microscopy plays a somewhat auxiliary role, while main information about the crystal structure comes from diffraction methods.
